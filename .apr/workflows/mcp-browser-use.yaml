  PROJECT: MCP Browser Use (repo: mcp-browser-use)

  Output requirements:
  - Output must be valid Markdown.
  - Do not include or repeat any attachment UI artifacts (for example: "attachments-bundle").

  First, read this AGENTS.md (project development guide):

  ```
  <contents of README will be included by oracle>
  ```

  ---

  NOW: Carefully review the plan below and propose your best revisions to make it
  more robust/reliable, more performant, more compelling/useful, and easier to
  execute as a real Python MCP server project.

  For each proposed change:
  - Explain the reasoning (why it makes the plan better).
  - Provide a git-diff style change versus the original plan text.

  Focus areas:
  1. Architecture gaps or improvements in the recipe learning pipeline
  2. Missing failure modes in the threat model
  3. Performance optimization opportunities (especially recipe execution)
  4. Security hardening (SSRF, credential leakage, CDP security)
  5. Testing gaps and strategies
  6. Missing phases or tasks in the implementation plan
  7. Developer experience and API design

  Plan (PLAN_TO_SHIP_MCP_BROWSER_USE.md):
